   RSL Type Checker
   Copyright (C) 1998 UNU/IIST

Version 1.0 February 1998 

The first version

Version 1.1 May 1998

- Scheme applications are only type checked once (on loading).
  Previously each instantiation was fully checked. The tool now uses
  less memory.

- The search path for object names occurring in scheme instantiations
  is corrected

- A -t option for type checking TRSL is added.  (This leaves a slight
  problem in that "wait" is accepted syntactically in RSL as a prefix
  operator.) 

- The with construct now takes a list of object expressions instead of
  a single one.
