1.  Rebuilding gentle, reflex and lib requires gcc 3.4, which seems
  hard to install.  Tried fixing for current gcc with #includes of
  stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h but resulting gentle crashes immediately
  on any .g file.  So continuing with existing gentle etc, which means
  building 32 bit version.

2.  Can run existing 32-bit gentle on 64 bit installation after
sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0

3.  Needed to install bison (part of YACC) and flex

4.  Changed src Makefile to use gcc -m32 instead of just gcc.  Needs
to build for 32 bits because of compatibility with gentle's grts.o

4.  Reported missing sys/cdefs.h.  So did 
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386

5.  Warnings about malloc and sprintf but otherwise OK

6.  used sudo dpkg -i rsltc_2.6.1-1_i386.deb to install, and it works.
